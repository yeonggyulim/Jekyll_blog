### 1. Goal of this course
  - Learning efficient data structure & algorithms.
  - Designing & writing large programs.
  - Understanding & designing data abstraction & interfaces.
  - Learning Java.

### 2. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
  - Object: A repository of data.
  - Class: Type of object.
  - Procedure or function that operates on an object or class.
  - Inheritance: A class may inherit properties from a more general class.
  - Polymorphism: One method works on several classes; even if the classes need different implementations.
  - Object-Orientd: Each object knows its own class & methods.

### 3. Java
  - Variables: you must declare them and their type.
    - Allocates memory to store an integer, type "int".
    - Names variable "x".
    - Also used to reference objects.
  - 2 Ways to get classes:
    - Use one defined by somebody else. Java has tons.
    - Define your own. (can store a reference to a String object.)
